# GrizzCTF Stego Challenge: Hidden in Plain Sight

## Challenge Description

In this challenge, participants are provided with an ordinary-looking image. However, not everything is as it seems. Buried within the pixels of this image lies a secret message, a flag that you must uncover to complete the challenge. Your task is to analyze the image, unravel its secrets, and extract the hidden message.

This challenge requires a keen eye, a bit of creativity, and some programming skills. Are you ready to dive into the pixels and reveal the hidden truths?

### What You're Given

Participants will be provided with a single PNG image file. Remember, the key to solving this challenge lies within this image.

### Objective

Your objective is to decode the secret message hidden within the image and submit the flag in the format `GrizzCTF{your_discovered_message_here}`.

### Tools You Might Need

- A programming environment capable of running Python scripts
- Libraries such as PIL (Python Imaging Library) or its successor, Pillow, for image manipulation
- Basic knowledge of digital image processing and binary data manipulation

### Hints

- The devil is in the details, or in this case, in the least significant bits.
- Sometimes, what you see is not all there is. Dive deeper into the pixel data.

Good luck!

# Params and RSA
**Objectives**:
- This challenge demonstrates the practical application of RSA encryption and decryption. Participants will leverage provided RSA parameters to decipher =the given ciphertext, gaining insights into the workings of this fundamental cryptographic system through their own research. 
- To solve this challenge, participants will need to write there own code to implement the RSA algorithm correctly as per the given parameters to find `d`(the private key) and successfully decrypt the ciphertext.

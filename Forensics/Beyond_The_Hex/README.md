# Magical Bytes Challenge

## Overview

Welcome to the "Magical Bytes" challenge, a cybersecurity puzzle designed to test your skills in digital forensics and file analysis. This challenge revolves around an image file named `cherryblossom.jpg`. However, not everything is as it seems. Your task is to uncover the true nature of this file.

## Objective

Determine the actual format of `cherryblossom.jpg` and extract the hidden flag.

## Flag Format

The flag is in the format: `GrizzCTF{magic_bytes_of_photo_here}`. You will need to find the magic bytes of the actual file format to complete the flag.

## Instructions

1. **Analyze the File:** Begin by examining the provided `cherryblossom.jpg` file. Use any tools or techniques at your disposal to understand its true format.
2. **Extract Magic Bytes:** Identify and extract the magic bytes that reveal the file's actual format.
3. **Construct the Flag:** Use the extracted magic bytes to construct the flag according to the specified format.
4. **Submit the Flag:** Once you have the correct flag, submit it to complete the challenge.

## Hints

- The file's extension may be misleading. Look beyond it to understand the file's true content.
- Consider using command-line tools like `file`, `xxd`, or hex editors to inspect the file more closely.
- Magic bytes are your key to solving this challenge. They are located at the beginning of the file and can tell you what the file really is.

## Tools

- `file`: Determine the type of file.
- `xxd` or similar hex editors: View the file's hexadecimal representation.

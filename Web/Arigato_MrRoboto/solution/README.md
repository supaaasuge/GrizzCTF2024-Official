# Arigato Mr.Roboto
Challenge Description: `"What I wouldn't give to be normal. To live in that bubble. Reality of the naive"`
This is a quote from the TV Show Mr. Robot. Based off this infomation, the challenge participant has to simply view `/robots.txt`


Description:


This reflection encapsulates the essence of our journey into the digital abyss. It's not just a quest for flags; it's an odyssey that questions the very fabric of our digital existence.

Challenge Objective:

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, revolves around the ancient yet ever-relevant file robots.txt. This file, a directive for the search engine crawlers, holds the key to advancing in this challenge. But beware, for not all paths are meant to be followed, and not all entries are meant to be obeyed by the likes of us.

    Begin by navigating to the /robots.txt file of the target website. This file, designed to tell search engine bots which parts of a site should not be crawled or indexed, will contain the first clue.

    Within the robots.txt, among the disallowed entries, a path will stand out: /arigato. This is your gateway. The name 'arigato', meaning 'thank you' in Japanese, is a nod to the gratitude expressed towards those who respect the boundaries set by robots.txt. But as a seeker of truths hidden in the digital veil, you must cross this boundary.

Instructions:

    Access the target website's robots.txt file by appending /robots.txt to the base URL.
    Locate the disallowed entry /arigato.
    Navigate to /arigato by appending it to the base URL of the website.
    Upon reaching the /arigato directory, your keen eyes and sharp wit will be rewarded with the flag you seek.

##### Flag Format:

The flag you discover will follow the standard format: grizzctf{something_here}, an emblem of your success and a testament to your skill in navigating the complexities of digital spaces.

##### Conclusion:

In a world where the naive live in bubbles of perceived reality, you've chosen to confront the truth, to seek what's hidden, and to question the norms. Remember, in the vast expanse of the internet, knowledge is power, and curiosity, when guided by skill and ethical intent, leads to enlightenment.

Capture the flag, and let it be known that you've delved into the depths where few dare to tread.
- It's not that serious but this is funny so im gonna leave it

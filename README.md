# GrizzCTF 2024


PWN is empty for the time being. I will likely spend thursday and friday putting these together. Only 3 total as this is kind of a lot of challenges already.
- This can be discussed.


##### TODO (Noted 02/13/24): 
- Copy over the `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, and `xinet.d` for a few challenges; I forgot to copy these over although the files are already filled out other than changing some names.
- Live Instance testing
- Load testing on different challenges (threaded Purposeful DoS basically)... This is to ensure the challenge containers are configured to handle all the compute required in case there is a lot more participants than expected etc..
